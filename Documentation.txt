Project Documentation: Personal Health Assistant 
1. Overview 
	The Personal Health Assistant is a mobile application designed to help users track their food intake, receive nutritional information, and get meal recommendations based on their dietary goals. 
	The assistant includes a chatbot that processes both text and images to analyze the user's food intake and provides insights about calories and nutrients. 
	The system will eventually include voice interaction. 
2. User Registration and Onboarding Workflow: 
	Step 1: User opens the app and registers using their email and name. 
	Step 2: After registration, the user is taken to a profile setup page where the following information is collected: 
			-	Age 
			-	Sex (Male/Female/Other) 
			-	Dietary Preference (Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, Eggetarian) 
			-	Height (in cm/inches) Weight (in kg/lbs) 
			-	Any medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, etc.) 
			-	User’s goal (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, maintaining health) 
3. Chatbot Interface 
	Once the user profile is set up, they are introduced to a chatbot interface. 
	Greeting: The chatbot will greet the user by name and ask: 
				"Hi [User's Name], how are you feeling today?" 
	User Interaction Features: 
		Text Input: The user can input text, including a description of their meals (e.g., "I ate 2 chapatis and dal"). 
		Image Input: The user can upload images of their meals, and the chatbot will process them to provide insights about the food’s calorie content and nutritional breakdown. 
		Voice Interaction (Future Feature): In the future, the chatbot will have the capability to process voice inputs, allowing for more seamless interaction. 
4. Food Meal Processing 
	Text Analysis: The chatbot will analyze the meal description provided in text and give a detailed breakdown of: 
					-	Calories Macronutrients (Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats) 
					-	Micronutrients (Vitamins, Minerals, etc.) 
	Image Analysis: The chatbot will use image recognition to identify food items and provide the same level of nutritional information. 
5. Recommendations 
	Based on Goals If the user has specified a goal during profile setup (e.g., weight loss or muscle gain), 
	the chatbot will also provide meal recommendations for the next meal. 
	Example Scenario: If a user is on a weight loss journey, and they had a calorie-rich lunch, 
					  the chatbot may recommend a lighter dinner such as a salad with a protein source like paneer or tofu. 
6. Future Enhancements 
	Voice Interaction: The chatbot will incorporate voice input functionality, enabling users to interact with the assistant via voice commands. 
	Personalized Health Tips: The system will suggest health tips based on user medical conditions (e.g., heart-healthy meals for users with hypertension). 
7. Data Privacy and Security 
	All user data, including health and nutritional information, will be stored securely with encryption in compliance with data protection regulations. 
8. Technology Stack 
	Frontend: Mobile app developed using React Native or Flutter for cross-platform support (iOS & Android) 
	Backend: Node.js with Express for handling user requests and responses Python and LLM for meal image analysis and text processing 
	Database: CosmosDB for storing user profiles and meal history 
	APIs: LLM or Nutritionix API (or similar) to fetch nutritional information from a database of food items. 
9. Key Features 
	Summary User Registration and Profile Setup Chatbot capable of processing text and images Personalized nutritional insights 
	Meal recommendations based on user goals Future addition of voice interaction
